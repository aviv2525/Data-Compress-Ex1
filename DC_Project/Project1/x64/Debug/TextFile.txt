[Verse 1]
Hard shove, feel the heavy weight
It's the same love that I push away
It be the same thing I always debate
Why you left me here for another
These days I tend to see red
'Cause all the women swimming in my head
Are not the same ones laying in my bed
But I do my best to ignore it

[Pre-Chorus]
But you still come up
You still come up

[Chorus]
It's all in my head, there's not much I can do
You set your pace, I'll keep mine too
Each time I chase, I feel dark blue
Confuse your face for someone new

[Verse 2]
I guess I owe you for most everything
Like the way I feel and the curse you bring
You got a lot of nerve to wanna hear me sing
After you tossed us into the gutter
Mad now like I was before
'Cause somebody's always asking who I do it for
But I don't wanna do it for you anymore
I do my best to ignore it

But you still come up
You still come up

[Chorus]
It's all in my head, there's not much I can do
You set your pace, I'll keep mine too
Each time I chase, I feel dark blue
Confuse your face for someone new

[Bridge]
Yeah I should let you go
Away from the grey that we both know
And I can't pass through Indio
Without feeling indigo
Yeah I should let this go
But it gets so hectic on my own
You can't be proud if I'm alone

[Chorus]
It's all in my head, there's not much I can do
You set your pace, I'll keep mine too
Each time I chase, I feel dark blue
Confuse your face for someone new

[Outro]
But you still come up
You still come up

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while
But I will not fake this stupid smile
‘Cause you robbed me, fed me the line
Your bounty was me, took all you could see

And worked just side by side
The trust and love we’d abide
Until you left home thrust with the tide
And put this hate back inside my eyes

[Chorus]
Are you blocking all the things
That have to do with me?
Is it easier now?
Do you feel any release?

Tell me how you fit in
And where do you begin?
Do you toast when they toast?
Do you sin when they sin?

[Verse 2]
Stepped through your place
Lust in my eyes, toyed with deceit
Planted your lies
Play it off well, say that I’m fine
Do I hold that small space in your mind?

Trying to break loose from your charm

And how can I feel anyone anymore?
And how can I feel anything anymore?
And how can I feel anything anymore?

[Chorus]
Are you blocking all the things

[Intro]
When you're up north, the ice is slick like my voice
She's like, "I never left you, this was all your choice"
I can't doubt it now, I might lose all my poise
When I mislead you on purpose, fade into the void
Feeling indigo
How 'bout you?
I feel indigo

[Verse 1]
And I wish you'd just call, and we could hash it out
I could tell you what I'm so mad about
Bet you're sick of hearin' me sulk and pout
Had so much on my mind 'til now
Like when we gonna do this? The where and how?
And if I see you, am I gonna curse you out?
Is it enough that I'm up right now?
Does it anger you that I chose a different route?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm sick of feeling that I'm late
Tired of having to restate: "I can't just sit around and wait
You're just not someone I can date"
Now look who can't hold their weight
I hope I'm wrong just for your sake
Using pills and flowers to sedate
Find me, heal me, keep my faith

You have to know every place I go
That feeling stuck that I offered trust and it left me solo
And if I haven't grown from every face I've known
Is it all for naught? Is that food for thought?
Yeah, there's things you don't know

I feel indigo, you've got what I need
I'm indigo, you've got what I need
You're not what I need
