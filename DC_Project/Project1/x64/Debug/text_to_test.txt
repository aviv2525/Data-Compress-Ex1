Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm that efficiently represents frequently occurring characters with shorter codes and less frequent ones with longer codes.
This technique, invented by David A. Huffman in 1952, optimizes storage and transmission of data.
By analyzing the frequency of characters in a given text, Huffman coding creates a binary tree where each leaf node corresponds to a character.
The path from the root to a leaf determines the character's binary representation.
Implementing this algorithm requires constructing a priority queue, building the tree, and generating the codes.
Test cases should include diverse inputs, such as repetitive strings, unique characters, and varying lengths, to ensure the algorithm handles all scenarios effectively.
